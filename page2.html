				<h2>How Virtual Reality is being used today</h2>
				<p>Unsurprisingly, the video games industry is one of the largest proponents of Virtual Reality. Support for the Oculus Rift headsets has already been jerry-rigged into games like Skyrim and Grand Theft Auto, but newer games like Elite: Dangerous come with headset support built right in. Many tried-and-true user interface metaphors in gaming have to be adjusted for VR (after all, who wants to have to pick items out of a menu that takes up your entire field of vision?), but the industry has been quick to adapt as the hardware for true Virtual Reality gaming has become more widely available.</p>

				<h2>VR for aviation, medicine, and the military</h2>
				<p>In aviation, medicine, and the military, Virtual Reality training is an attractive alternative to live training with expensive equipment, dangerous situations, or sensitive technology. Commercial pilots can use realistic cockpits with VR technology in holistic training programs that incorporate virtual flight and live instruction. Surgeons can train with virtual tools and patients, and transfer their virtual skills into the operating room, and studies have already begun to show that such training leads to faster doctors who make fewer mistakes. Police and soldiers are able to conduct virtual raids that avoid putting lives at risk.</p>

				<h2>VR a Big Change in the Automobile Industry</h2>
				<p>If you have an automobile industry then you know that only a few models are kept in display and it is also difficult to show all the models to a particular customer. Also if the customer is confused between two or three-car then it is very difficult and it will be A wastage of time to take the drive of all three and check all the features of three and choose one. So to decrease the effort of your and increase the options for customers, virtual reality has given great advantage as it views the car in a 360-degree view. So that the customer can take test drives, select the exterior/interior, explore features, switch on lights, explore the accessories, etc this all through interactive experiences. If you give this experience to your customers then surely you will increase your business.</p>

That helps the project stakeholders to study, suggest if any changes or fixes are required, this all at an early stage so that you don’t have to suffer after the product is ready and make the changes.</p>
